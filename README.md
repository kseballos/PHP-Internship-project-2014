# iRequest-Online-job-order-service-request-submission-and-monitoring-system-
This project was created last 2014 as part of the requirement for my internship. 

iRequest Online JO/Service/Support Submission, mainly a monitoring system developed to replace the manual JO and Service Request Forms Submitted to FED and IT. A web-based system is for sole use of GTC employees only and is accessible with GTC's computer network

•	A system (Request Submission and Status, Ratings, Percentage Monitoring,) which replaced manual transactions providing solution and convenience for each department and employees. (Reducing time and effort spent)
•	A system with specific limitations depending on the user
•	Gathered these prior to development of software: 
  o	Data Gathering 
  o	Formulating Business Flows using UML
  o	Converting UML to lines of codes 
  o	Checking different transactions by having dry run 
•	Conducted User Testing to guide users about the different transactions within the system 
•	Created automatic calculations to generate reports regarding the Ratings and Percentage for every finished request (saving up to 95% of the time and effort spent compared to the manual computation)
